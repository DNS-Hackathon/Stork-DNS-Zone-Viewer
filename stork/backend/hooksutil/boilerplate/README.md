# Stork hook

This directory is a boilerplate of the Stork hook. It has initialized the git repository and contains a few pre-implemented files:

- `README.md` - this file
- `plugin.go` - the ready implementation of the mandatory hook functions
- `callouts.go`  - the callout carrier file. It contains some TODO statements that should be filled with the hook logic.
- `Rakefile` - the Rake build system file with a few starting commands to build and test the hook. It's optional to use.

Have fun!
